The DoubleDeepQNetwork code is the final code I used in my submission. I have provided two additional pieces as I spent over 40 hours trying to get them to work, 
however due to the inherent instability of the epilepsy environment, I was unable to train a stable RL model. I hope my effort on these pieces of code can be considered
as I do not feel the submitted coded is a true representation of my ability and intuitive understanding of reinforcement learning.
